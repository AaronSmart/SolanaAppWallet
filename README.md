Solana APP is another version of sollet wallet for mobile 

Solana Pay is the entry point into the system. It lives directly between web2 & web3,    
receiving web2 payloads & converting them into web3 transactions. The power of this

hold amazing things.

Cryptocurrencies are bringing forward a decentralized world, and Solana Pay is a perfect 
example of what the possibilities are.
